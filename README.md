## Getting Started
All of the files can be loaded with your Git terminal. Copy the files to your local directory and type 

    node index.js.

### Installing
    1. Go to https://github.com/ruthtech/profile-generator and click on the "Clone or Download" button. 
    2. Choose "Download ZIP". 
    3. Unzip into a directory. If you're on Windows, open File Explorer and navigate to the download directory. Select the ZIP file, right click, and choose "Extract All". Accept the default location.
    4. Once the file is unzipped, navigate to profile-generator-master.
    5. If you don't have the prerequisites installed, type the following:
